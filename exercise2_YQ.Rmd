# CHANGE DESCRIPTION
# I conduct a simimlar instrumental variables regression with mother's education
# is used as an instrument, and is not in the first set of variables. Similar variables
# are selected to be adjusted in the model as in the example as asge, marital, and race 
# are assumed to be less related to underlying ability and so are controlled for 
# in the "first stage" regression too. The analogous OLS regression without mother's education
# is also fitted. I found people who have higher education in a way that's correlated with
# their mother having higher education, even holding fixed age, marital
# status, and race, receive ~13.4% higher wages for every year of education.
# A different inital model was fitted with similar y variable and different x variables.
# The updated x variables are hours, IQ, KWW, educ, exper, tenure, and age, The
# model results are printed out.

# Instrumental Variables example

#If gets error, add code< install.packages("Hmisc",dependecies=T)> or download a new version R studio
wages<-read.csv('http://inta.gatech.s3.amazonaws.com/wage2.csv')
iv.results<-tsls(lwage ~ educ + age + married + black + exper, ~ feduc + age + married + black + exper, data=wages)
# Run an instrumental variables regression. Note that father's education is
# used for an instrument, and is not in the first set of variables. Age,
# marital, status, and race are assumed to be less related to underlying
# ability and so are controlled for in the "first stage" regression too.


ols.results<-lm(lwage ~ educ + age + married + black + exper, data=wages)
# Run the analogous OLS regression without father's education

print(summary(ols.results))
print(summary(iv.results))
# Note that the point estimate for education has now gone up. This suggests
# that people who have higher education in a way that's correlated with
# their father having higher education, even holding fixed age, marital
# status, and race, receive ~13% higher wages for every year of education.
# Also note that the standard error on education is higher for the iv than
# ols results. The reason for this is that in IV, we're using only some of
# the variation in education: only the part related to father's education,
# so it's like there's less variation overall

###Code change
